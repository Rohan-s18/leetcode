# Leetcode
## Author: Rohan Singh
This repository contains source code for Leetcode and Hackerrank problems for Python Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms. You can use the code here as a reference for interview or competitive programming practice. As of now all of the source code is in Python but I will try to add some C++ solutions for the code as well in the future.

This repository contains three directories for different levels of difficulty of problems. For **technical interview** practice I would suggest checking out the **easy** and **medium** difficulty levels as most of the questions you will see there will be of the same level of difficulty. The **hard** problems (not to be confused with NP-hard) are more suited towards practice for competitve programming competitions such as ICPC.

The code is organized in the following format within each of the three directories:  
  - **\<problem name\>.md**: this contains the problem in markdown format (including demo and test cases).  
  - **\<problem name\>.py**: this contains the solution source code in python for the corresponding problem.
